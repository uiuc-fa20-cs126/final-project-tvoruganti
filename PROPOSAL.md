<h1>Project Proposal</h1>	

<h4>Project Explanation</h4>	

For my project, I want to code and create a path finding algorithm and 
visualizer for it. I do not know how many different algorithms I will implement. It may be 1, 
or it may be 5. I will start with an A* algorithms and implement others. My visualizer will allow 
the user to place 2 point and draw walls and barriers. Then the algorithm will run, showing the steps 
it is taking, and draw a line showing the path it took at the end. The graphic component will be graph like
with squares so you can draw borders and visualize it easily.

<h4>Why did I choose it?</h4>	

I want to do this project because I am interested in path finding algorithms.
These algorithms are what Apple and Google maps use when determining routes for drivers 
and I am very interested in how these algorithms work and which are the best. I want to 
implement multiple heuristics so I can compare them with all of them in front of me.

<h4>Timeline</h4>	

I want to finish the visualizer first. So I will finish it first depending on how long it takes.
Hopefully I can complete the visualizer in a week so I can spend the rest on algorithms but we will see.
The visualizer doesn't seem to complicated to me and I believe it is the easier part of this project.
I think the algorithms will be tougher. I would like to spend the 2nd week creating the different heuristics and 
testing them for correctness. I also have to link them to the visualizer so this will take the most time.
I imagine this will go into week 3 as well. For week 3, I want to wrap up the little things by reformatting, adding comments,
finishing tests and refining my code to look nicer and maybe add a few new features. If I have any extra time, I will
spend it adding more heuristics to my program.
